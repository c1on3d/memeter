# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for recreating and improving the Render deployment configuration for the Memeter application, a full-stack cryptocurrency token tracking application with real-time WebSocket functionality.

## Glossary

- **Render_Platform**: Cloud platform service for deploying web applications and databases
- **Memeter_Application**: The full-stack cryptocurrency token tracker application
- **Web_Service**: The Node.js/Express backend service deployed on Render
- **Database_Service**: PostgreSQL database instance hosted on Render
- **Environment_Variables**: Configuration values stored securely in Render's environment
- **Build_Process**: Automated compilation and bundling of application code
- **Health_Check**: Automated monitoring to ensure service availability

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to deploy my Memeter application to Render, so that it's accessible on the internet with proper database connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed, THE Web_Service SHALL serve the application on a public URL
2. THE Web_Service SHALL connect to the Database_Service using secure credentials
3. THE Web_Service SHALL build successfully using the npm build scripts
4. THE Web_Service SHALL start using the production start command
5. THE Database_Service SHALL be accessible only by the Web_Service

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper environment configuration, so that my application runs correctly in production with all required services enabled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Web_Service SHALL use environment variables for all configuration values
2. THE Web_Service SHALL connect to PostgreSQL instead of SQLite in production
3. THE Web_Service SHALL enable PumpPortal WebSocket service by default
4. THE Web_Service SHALL use the correct public base URL for the deployed service
5. THE Web_Service SHALL disable database logging in production

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated deployment, so that my application updates automatically when I push code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to the main branch, THE Render_Platform SHALL trigger a new deployment
2. THE Render_Platform SHALL run the build process automatically
3. IF the build fails, THEN THE Render_Platform SHALL maintain the previous working version
4. THE Render_Platform SHALL provide deployment logs for troubleshooting
5. THE Web_Service SHALL restart automatically after successful builds

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper health monitoring, so that I can ensure my application is running correctly and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Render_Platform SHALL monitor the Web_Service health automatically
2. THE Web_Service SHALL respond to health check requests on the root path
3. IF the service becomes unresponsive, THEN THE Render_Platform SHALL restart it automatically
4. THE Render_Platform SHALL provide access to application logs
5. THE Web_Service SHALL log startup information including configuration status

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want secure database configuration, so that my application data is protected and properly managed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Database_Service SHALL use strong authentication credentials
2. THE Database_Service SHALL be accessible only from the Web_Service
3. THE Web_Service SHALL use connection pooling for database efficiency
4. THE Database_Service SHALL persist data across service restarts
5. THE Web_Service SHALL handle database connection failures gracefully
